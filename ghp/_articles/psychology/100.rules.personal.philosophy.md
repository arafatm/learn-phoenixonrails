title: 100 Rules — Personal Philosophy
---

> Years of notes on business, productivity, courage, stress, success,
> relationships and more.

I began journaling in 2013. A few years later, I started collecting rules that
I read every morning. Each rule points to a personal story. These are
reminders.

✦ ✦ ✦

## [😠](https://emojipedia.org/angry-face/) Stress

_Choosing battles wisely._

1. **“Focus on what you control.”** — It’s unhelpful to dwell on things outside of your control.

2. **“This too shall pass.”** — _“There are more things likely to frighten us than there are to crush us; we suffer more often in imagination than in reality.”_ –[Seneca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_the_Younger)

3. **“Not wanting something is as good as having it.”** — If you don’t want something, you’re just as satisfied as someone who has it. [Naval Ravikant](https://twitter.com/naval) says that _“…desire is a contract that you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.”_

## [📅](https://emojipedia.org/calendar/) Productivity

_Getting shit done._

4. **“Perfect is a myth. Make a choice.”** — Start and iterate.

5. **“Use models.”** — Don’t recreate the wheel. Learn from others and save time.

6. **“Start super simple.”** — Make the simplest version first. Don’t complicate things. Build an MVP. Or a [concierge MVP](https://www.allencheng.com/concierge-mvp/).

7. **“Read and listen to whatever you’re most interested in.”** — We get more out of what interests us. Find something that you enjoy reading instead of struggling through books. This idea came from [Shane Parrish](https://twitter.com/ShaneAParrish).

8. **“The best returns in life come from compound interest.”** — This applies to relationships, habits and business. Thanks again [Naval](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7PvBO7aRV4).

9. **“Successful people say no to almost everything.”** — Focus.

10. **“Get it working by any means.”** — Inspired by [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development). Improve the solution _after_ the test passes. This applies to more than code.

11. **“Hire/build when it hurts.”** — Handle your most painful problems first. Avoid premature optimization.

12. **“Set goals. And work backwards.”** — Use big goals and small goals. Milestones can expose whether you undershot or overshot.

## [👁](https://emojipedia.org/eye/) Influences

_Curating influences._

13. **“Don’t read/watch the news. Skewed incentives.”** — The news is a war on our attention. We are frightened into coming back to find out what else to be afraid of. This leads to [availability bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic) and pessimism. Some of us are more afraid to fly than drive. Counteract the news with positive propaganda.

14. **“You’re the average of the 5 people you surround yourself with.”** — This goes beyond people. What books, podcasts, videos or music do you consume?

15. **“Stay away from negative people.”** — Vibes are contagious.

## [🧐](https://emojipedia.org/face-with-monocle/) Decisions

_Making good decisions._

16. **“Listen to your gut.”** — Don’t ignore your instincts.

17. **“Hard choices, easy life. Easy choices, hard life.”** — Hard decisions are often the most important. [Ben Horowitz](https://twitter.com/bhorowitz) tells us to _[run towards the fear](https://a16z.com/2019/10/17/how-to-be-effective-ceo-leader/)_.

18. **“Consensus is regression to the mean.”** — Trying to appease everyone takes you nowhere.

19. **“Think probabilistically.”** — Think grey. Not black and white. This comes from [Annie Duke](https://twitter.com/AnnieDuke) and her book, _[Thinking in Bets](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Bets-Making-Smarter-Decisions/dp/0735216355)_. Assign percentages to your beliefs instead of speaking in absolutes.

20. **“Short engagements. Test situations.”** — Test partnerships and commitments with trial runs. Build a small project together before going all in.

21. **“Red team. Blue team.”** — Approach decisions as a critic and a supporter. Answers often reveal themselves.

22. **“IDK = No”** — If you’re uncertain, the answer should probably be no. This comes from [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/) who wrote [_No “yes.” Either “HELL YEAH!” or “no.”_](https://sivers.org/hellyeah)

23. **“Know your alternatives.”** — You always have a choice. Remain aware of your alternatives. Has your current path become too expensive? Has a better option emerged?

24. **“Don’t risk ruin. Not even a small chance.”** — This is what killed Long-Term Capital Management. _[When Genius Failed](https://www.amazon.com/When-Genius-Failed-Long-Term-Management/dp/0375758259)_ tells the story.

## 🗣️ Communication

_Being understood._

25. **“Use simple language. Few syllables. Short sentences. Short paragraphs.”** — Simplicity is hard to achieve. Work hard so your audience doesn’t have to.

26. **“Our brains are built to enjoy stories.”** — Stories help information stick.

## [🙂](https://emojipedia.org/slightly-smiling-face/) People

_Understanding others._

27. **“We’re all driven by the fundamental desire to be appreciated”.** — Don’t underestimate the role of emotion.

28. **“Don’t argue. Bet.”** — Test belief through sacrifice not words.

29. **“Appeal to interest, not reason.”** — We don’t care about what makes sense. We care about what makes sense for us.

30. **“Misery loves company.”** — So does happiness.

31. **“Happy people rarely become haters.”** — Unconstructive critics are often dealing with their own demons.

32. **“Difficulty reveals character.”** — Our masks fall during struggle. Build friendships through shared struggle. Jiu-Jitsu, hackathons, work, travel.

33. **“We stereotype all of the time. Rightly or wrongly. Don’t ignore it.** [**Signals matter**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_theory)**.”** — We take mental shortcuts to conserve energy. Use pattern interrupts when you’re being negatively stereotyped. Life is short. Not fair.

34. **“The more you understand incentives, the less you take things personally.”** — Incentives drive behavior. Sometimes it’s not personal. Change incentives instead of _trying_ to change people.

35. **“Hurt people, hurt people.”** — Don’t react. Remember this.

36. **“Don’t try to change someone’s worldview. Take those who see it and take them further.”** — It’s hard to change someone’s worldview. It’s easier to help someone who already sees it. What’s the best use of your time?

## [👯‍♂️](https://emojipedia.org/men-with-bunny-ears-partying/) Relationships

_Building connections._

37. **“Trust saves time.”** — Invest in trust on the frontend and reap rewards on the backend. High trust relationships move faster and get more done.

38. **“Focus on compounding relationships.”** — Focus on building relationships with long-term potential.

39. **“Don’t force relationships.”** — What’s forced eventually falls apart. Forcing only delays the inevitable.

## 🤝 Negotiation

_Getting what you want._

40. **“Whoever cares less wins negotiations.”** — Who can afford to walk away? Who needs it the least? This person tends to get the best deal.

41. **“Negotiation and business are about alternatives.”** — Good decisions are relative. It’s about choosing the best option among alternatives. _Know your [BATNA](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/deals/what-is-batna/)_.

## 🧘🏿‍♀️ Wisdom

_Knowing yourself._

42. **“It’s easier to resist in the beginning than the end.”** — Mistakes become harder to correct the longer they linger. [Sunk costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost) play tricks on us. Suck it up and rip the bandaid off now. Toxic relationships, bad hires and tough conversations. It’s immediate pain versus chronic pain.

43. **“To know all is to forgive all.”** — You would be more understanding if you knew everything about a person. Look closer when something doesn’t make sense.

## 🌱 Growth

_Constantly improving._

44. **“Focus on doing the thing, not the outcome.”** — Commit to the process, not the outcome. You control whether you do it, not how it turns out.

45. **“Continuous improvement requires feedback.”** — Feedback is a gift. No feedback. No improvement.

46. **“How to build confidence? Do things just outside your comfort zone. And repeat as it expands.”** — This fuses confidence with progressive overload. Confidence-building can become a habit. This comes from [Tim Ferriss](https://twitter.com/tferriss).

47. **“If you decide to only do what works. You’re leaving a lot of opportunity on the table.”** — Experiment.

## 🧗🏿‍♀️ Courage

_Doing despite fear._

48. **“Courage is a muscle that you need to train.”** — Picture courage as a muscle that atrophies if it goes unused. Courage can also be strengthened through [progressive overload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_overload). This came from a conversation with [Harry Dry](https://twitter.com/harrydry).

49. **“New things scare us. Do it anyway.”** — By acknowledging fear, we are better able to move past it.

50. **“The biggest upside comes from being outside your comfort zone.”** — In the words of [DJ Khaled](https://twitter.com/djkhaled), _major_ 🔑  _alert_. There will be an entire post on this.

51. **“Fear is a good thing. It means you’re close to making a breakthrough.”** — Fear can indicate potential growth opportunities.

## 👩🏽‍🎨 Design

_Making things._

52. **“Trying to appeal to all leads to average.”** — We make too many concessions by trying to appeal to everyone. [Seth Godin](https://www.sethgodin.com/) writes about the importance of [being important to a small group](https://seths.blog/2014/06/in-search-of-meaningful/). This rule mirrors _“Consensus is regression to the mean.”_ But as [David Senra](https://twitter.com/davidsenra1) says, _repetition is persuasive_.

53. **“Brevity is the soul of wit.”** — Shorter is better.

54. **“Keep it simple.”** — Stay away from unnecessary complexity. _“Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.”_ -Einstein

55. **“Make it work. THEN make it pretty.”** — It’s easier to find an elegant solution once you have something working. This applies to any craft.

56. **“Don’t make them think.”** — Make it obvious.

## 💼 Business

_Delivering value._

57. **“Start with problems. Not solutions.”** — Start by studying the problem instead of offering solutions. Study the lock before you make a key.

58. **“Frustration is an opportunity.”** — Keep an idea journal. Jot down your problems. Some are business opportunities.

59. **“The most important part of business is the market. It’s easier to ride a wave than it is to make one.”** — A good team won’t survive a bad market. A good product won’t survive a bad market. A bad team with a bad product can survive in a good market. Pick hungry markets. This comes from [Marc Andreessen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen) who wrote _[The Only Thing That Matters](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html)_.

60. **“Business opportunities can lead to others.”** — Build something even if you don’t have a “good” idea yet. We find new problems by solving problems.

61. **“A company can be your vehicle for continuous learning.”** — Do something. Don’t just study.

62. **“Awareness → Interest → Decision → Action”** — Marketing is about awareness and conversion. Be visible. [Pieter Levels](https://twitter.com/levelsio), [Andrey Azimov](https://twitter.com/AndreyAzimov) and [Danielle Johnson](https://twitter.com/dinkydani21) are great examples of this.

63. **“50% Rule. 1/2 Growth. 1/2 Product.”** — Spend half of your time talking to customers and half building. Don’t endlessly build without feedback.

64. **“Does the business have network effects? Does it require funding?”** — [Network effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect) determine the number and size of the businesses a market. These are winner take most games. Nextdoor, LinkedIn, Facebook. Building these companies often involves raising money. Is this the kind of business that you want to run? Consider founder-market fit.

65. **“The more you ship. The more you increase your chance of success. Throw enough against the wall and something’s bound to stick.”** —[Andrew Pierno](https://twitter.com/andrewpierno) wrote about this in _[The Edison Approach to Profitability](https://medium.com/@AndrewPierno/the-edison-approach-to-profitability-a6db28f42800)_.

66. **“Consider buying a business. A statistically profitable approach.”** — Validating business ideas involves a lot of false starts. Buying a business with product-market fit _can_ be a statistically profitable approach. _Price affects risk._ [Nassim Nicholas Taleb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb) discussed the idea of statistical profitability in [Fooled by Randomness](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001FA0W5W).

67. **“Copy businesses that are working. These are formulas. Steal and improve them.”** — Find a proven market. Study the problem. Be different or better or both.

68. **“Choose the fastest option. Refactor later.”** — Prioritize speed early on. If you’re unable to validate an idea, there may be no long-term to worry about.

69. **“Theory of 3 (good money) and 7 (wealth).”** — Pick something that you can stick with for the long run. The hosts of [The TMBA Podcast](https://www.tropicalmba.com/podcasts/) have a theory that it takes three years of working on something to make good money and seven years to generate wealth.

70. **“Build what YOU need or want.”** — [Sahil Lavingia](https://twitter.com/shl) says that _if you build for yourself then you at least have one customer_. It doesn’t guarantee that others will want your solution but it’s a good start.

## 💁🏾‍♂️ Selling

_Persuading._

71. **“Ask for feedback to sell.”** — _If you want money, ask for advice. If you want advice, ask for money_.

72. **“Don’t try to sell what you wouldn’t buy.”** — Confidence is palpable. Potential customers will know if you believe in what you’re selling.

73. **“Deliver value and build trust before you try to sell.”** — Trust saves time. Write great content. Offer a free trial.

74. **“Have a rejection goal.”** — Each ‘no’ moves you closer to your goal. Flip the psychology of selling. [Carl Jacobi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Gustav_Jacob_Jacobi) told us to _“Invert. Always invert.”_

75. **“Start with why. They’ll be more likely to comply.”** — Explain why something is important before making a request.

## 🙃 Enjoying Life

_Living without regrets._

76. **“If you don’t HAVE to keep reading or listening, don’t.”** — Don’t trudge through books, podcasts or movies. Pick something else up. You don’t have to finish every book.

77. **“The journey is the reward. Hedonistic adaptation.”** — Lottery winners return to their baseline happiness levels. Learn to love the process. That’s where 99% of your time is spent.

78. **“We get more out of what interests us.”** — You learn more when you’re engaged. [Charlie Munger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger) says _follow your natural drift_.

79. **“Memento Mori.”** — Your time is limited. Live with urgency. Remember death.

## 🥇 Success

_Winning._

80. **“Don’t self-reject.”** — Don’t tell yourself no before someone else can. This came from [Sahil Lavingia](https://twitter.com/shl).

81. **“Knowledge is (potential) power. Action makes it so.”** — Applied knowledge is power. It takes courage and energy to activate. [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/) said that _if information was the answer, then we’d all be billionaires with perfect abs._

82. **“Play long-term games. Compound returns.”** — Focus on the long-term. Most benefits come from later stages of [compounding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_interest). Pick up habits that you can see yourself sticking with. [Jeff Bezos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos) says to _focus on what doesn’t change_.

83. **“Play asymmetric games. Life is not baseball. 1 hit can pay for 1000 runs.”** — Some activities have asymmetric upside. Reading, writing, coding, selling, leading, comfort challenges, publishing. Play games with asymmetric upside.

84. **“Ask for what you want. You can’t get what you don’t ask for.”** — You’ll get a yes or a know.

85. **“Move with intent. You’re more likely to get what you want.”** — Are you living proactively or reactively? Establish a north star to orient your decisions around. ‘_If you don’t know what you want, you end up with a lot that you don’t._‘ –[Chuck Palahnuik](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2546.Chuck_Palahniuk)

86. **“We thrive in niches. Specialize.”** — Focus on what you’re good at and rely on others for the rest. Leverage the API instead of building from scratch.

87. **“Wealth is made in extreme concentration.”** — Wealth is maintained through diversification but made in extreme concentration. Focus.

88. **“Price affects risk.”** — If an experiment is cheap, just do it. The more the price goes up, the more you should reconsider.

89. **“Follow up.”** — This can yield dividends.

90. **“Live below your means for freedom and options.”** — Establish a margin of safety to take more risks. [James Clear](https://twitter.com/JamesClear) says that ‘_Your success depends on the risks you take. Your survival depends on the risks you avoid._‘

91. **“Don’t be desperate.”** — Desperation often results in bad deals.

92. **“Ship daily/weekly/monthly. Build your shipping muscle.”** — Become comfortable exposing your art to an audience and embracing feedback.

93. **“Fuck imposter syndrome. Do it.”** — We second-guess ourselves a lot. Do not wait for permission. It may never come. Acknowledge self-doubt and move past it.

## ⏳ Management

_Being effective._

94. **“Put your name on it. This makes you try harder. Accountability.”** — You work harder when your name is on the line.

95. **“Get the incentives right.”** — It’s the most important thing in management. You get what you reward. Align incentives.

## 🕺🏾 Personal

_Adjusting for your own quirks._

96. **“Associate growth with doing. Not reading/watching/listening.”** — Don’t overstudy and underexecute.

97. **“Do high energy tasks early in the day.”** — Do creative work when you have the most energy.

98. **“Reading fiction = Increased empathy and creativity. Better verbal communication and writing. And less stress via escapism.”** — I once avoided novels because I didn’t know what I would learn. I still don’t know. But I read fiction for other reasons.

99. **“Use podcasts to stay motivated.”** — Listening to other misfits helps me stay motivated.

100. **“Habit levels. 3/10/30/100/300/1000/etc.” —** The rule of 3 and 10. This came from an interview with [Phil Libin](https://twitter.com/plibin?lang=en) in [Tools of Titans](https://www.amazon.com/Tools-Titans-Billionaires-World-Class-Performers/dp/1328683788). It states that everything changes at multiples of 3 and 10. When a company triples in size, everything breaks. I use multiples of 3 and 10 to celebrate milestones in habits and business. Gamify your life to stay engaged through the [messy middle](https://www.amazon.com/Messy-Middle-Finding-Through-Hardest/dp/0735218072).

My Journals

Thanks for reading. These rules emerged from years of refining and transferring notes.

The goal is _not_ to remember everything. I read the list with problems in mind. The path usually becomes clear by the time I finish.

🤔 What rules do you live by? Share some with me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/DruRly).
